        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nasi lemak is a dish originating in Malay cuisine that consists of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf.
             It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish.[7][8][9]
              It is also the native dish in neighbouring areas with significant Malay populations such as Singapore,[10] Brunei, 
              and Southern Thailand.</p>
         
        <h2>Ingredient</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>coconut milk steamed rice</li>
            <li>2 cups rice</li>
            <li>tamarind pulp (size of a small ping pong ball)</li>
            <li>1 cup ikan bilis (dried anchovies)</li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs (cut into half)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Just like making steamed rice, rinse your rice and drain. Add the coconut milk, a pinch of salt, and some water. Add the pandan leaves into the rice and cook your rice.</li>
            <li>Pound the prawn paste together with shallots, garlic, and deseeded dried chilies with a mortar and pestle. You can also grind them with a food processor. Slice the red onion into rings.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan and fry the spice paste until fragrant. Add in the onion rings. Add in the ikan bilis and stir well. Add tamarind juice, salt, and sugar. Simmer on low heat until the gravy thickens. Set aside.</li>
